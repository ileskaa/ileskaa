### Welcome to my GitHub!
I currently speak the following languages:
- Python
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- PHP
- SQL
- LaTeX
- VBA

And I'm always eager to learn new ones.
   
Below are listed some of my contributions.

## Web development
#### Projects I've worked on
- Before Christmas 2022, I wrote a Secret Santa app for my colleagues. Through the app, everyone drew randomly a person to whom they offered a gift while keeping their identity secret. I coded the backend using Node.js and a Redis database. I used vanilla JavaScript for the frontend.

- For December 2021, I created an online Advent calendar for my close friends. The idea was to share a little surprise every day, in the wait for Christmas.

- I created a flashcard app that can be used to study programming concepts. Node.js, Express, and Pug were used in the process.

## Python
#### Librairies I've Used the Most
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for linear regressions, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines
- Beautiful Soup for web scraping
- what I'm currently learning: TensorFlow for neural networks
#### Kaggle Competitions
I've taken part in a few Kaggle machine learning competitions:
- Titanic:
   - using linear regression: https://github.com/ileskaa/titatic-linear-regression
   - using random forests: https://github.com/ileskaa/titanic-random-forest
#### Certifications
I successfuly passed the IBM data science professional certificate, which can be viewed on the "Licences and certifications" section of my LinkedIn profile: https://fi.linkedin.com/in/akseli-ingervo

## VBA
In the context of my work as internal auditor in the financial sector, I've written many macros, including the following:
- folder drilldowns
   - e.g., a macro to automatically fill a workbook based on 500 job descriptions
- automatically converting .msg files to pdf files
- fusioning hundreds of files classed by date into a single document in order to perform data analysis
- converting PDF files to .docx, and then extracting tabular data
- updating Excel workbooks based on CSV files

## Operating Systems
I use Linux as my main operating system. I have used several distributions over the years, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Kali.
I am also very familiar with the Windows environment.
