### Welcome to my Github!

You'll find below a list of project I've worked on.

## Web development
For Christmas 2021, I created an online advent calendar for a group of friends. The idea was to share a little something every day.

## Python
Librairies I've used the most:
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for linear regressions, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines
- what I'm currently learning: TensorFlow for neural networks

## VBA
In the context of my work as internal auditor in the financial sector, I've written several many scripts incorporating the following:
- folder drilldowns
- automatically converting .msg files to pdf files
- fusioning hundreds of files classed by date into a single document to allow data analysis
