### Welcome to my GitHub!
I didn't learn programming at school; I taught myself to do it. That how much I love coding.
   
I currently speak the following languages:
- Python
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- PHP
- VBA
- SQL

And I'm always eager to learn new ones.
   
You'll find below a list of projects I've worked on.

## Web development
#### Projects I've worked on
- For Christmas 2021, I created an online advent calendar for a group of friends. The idea was to share a little something every day.

- I created a flashcard app that can be used to study programming concepts. Node.js, Express, and Pug were used in the process.

- For christmas 2022, I wrote a secret santa app for my colleagues. The idea is that everyone will randomly draw a person to whom they'll have to offer a gift while keeping their identity secret. For this project, I didn't use Express since I wanted to understand better what's happening behind the scenes. I therefore coded the backend using solely Node.js and a Redis database.

## Python
#### Librairies I've used the most
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for linear regressions, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines
- Beautiful Soup for web scraping
- what I'm currently learning: TensorFlow for neural networks
#### Kaggle competitions
I've taken part in a few Kaggle machine learning competitions:
- Titanic:
   - using linear regression: https://github.com/ileskaa/titatic-linear-regression
   - using random forests: https://github.com/ileskaa/titanic-random-forest
#### Certifications
I successfuly passed the IBM data science professional certificate, which can be viewed on the "Licences and certifications" section of my LinkedIn profile: https://fi.linkedin.com/in/akseli-ingervo
## VBA
In the context of my work as internal auditor in the financial sector, I've written many macros, including the following:
- folder drilldowns
   - e.g., a macro to automatically fill a workbook based on 500 job descriptions
- automatically converting .msg files to pdf files
- fusioning hundreds of files classed by date into a single document in order to perform data analysis
- converting PDF files to .docx, and then extracting tabular data
- updating Excel workbooks based on CSV files

## Operating systems
I'm currently working on Windows, but I've used Linux for several years in the past. I've played with several distros, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Mint.
