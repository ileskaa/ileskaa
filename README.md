### Welcome to my GitHub!
I didn't learn programming at school; I taught myself to do it. That how much I love coding.
   
Let's dive right in. I currently speak the following languages...
- Python
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- PHP
- VBA
- SQL

...and I'm always eager to learn new ones.
   
You'll find below a list of projects I've worked on.

## Web development
#### Projects I've worked on:
- For Christmas 2021, I created an online advent calendar for a group of friends. The idea was to share a little something every day.

- I created a flashcard app that can be used to study programming concepts. Node.js, Express, and Pug were used in the process.

## Python
#### Librairies I've used the most:
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for linear regressions, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines
- what I'm currently learning: TensorFlow for neural networks
   
#### Certifications:
I successfuly passed the IBM data science professional certificate, which can be viewed on the "Licences and certifications" section of my LinkedIn profile: https://fi.linkedin.com/in/akseli-ingervo
## VBA
In the context of my work as internal auditor in the financial sector, I've written many scripts incorporating the following concepts:
- folder drilldowns
- automatically converting .msg files to pdf files
- fusioning hundreds of files classed by date into a single document to allow data analysis
